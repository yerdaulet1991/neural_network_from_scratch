## Neural Network from scratch

This implementation is a two-layered (one hidden layer) Neural Network implemented from scratch using only Numpy.<br/>
<br/>
To be able to run main.py, the mnist dataset has to be downloaded and unzipped/extracted to the mnist folder. Furthermore, a few extra python packages are needed (see inside .py files).
